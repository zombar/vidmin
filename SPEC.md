I have an app called vidmin and the url is vidmin.cc (a riff on Vitamin C to hopefully make it easier to remember), the app is a minimalistic video player written in react / electron. The apps USP is that it is able to download, convert and upscale files that it plays (and save the results)

I require a logo pack for the app, including a banner for use on the Github repo. I'm thinking the that the logo / icon should be orange or citrus related, with a video reel or the skin of the fruit as the film. I'm thinking the icon should be stylised and cartoonish, and match the material UI theme.

Provide the files for the logo pack individually and at the correct proportions (with transparency if needed)
